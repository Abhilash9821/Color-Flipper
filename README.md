# Color-Flipper

This JavaScript program creates a random hex color generator. When a button is clicked, it picks six random elements (digits 0-9 and letters A-F) to form a hex color code. This code is then applied as the background color of the webpage. The core logic involves selecting random elements from an array and concatenating them to form a hex color.
